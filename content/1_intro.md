The work is examining why and how Dutch finance was so heavily involved in rebuilding Spokane after the 1889 fire, as well as early boosterism and agricultural land ventures in the area. The work will be asking how a largely speculative place like Spokane in 1890 projected American identity while being so heavily shaped by foreign interest and what regional identity was maintained after these interests were liquidated and the capital returned to Holland.

While Eastern Washington University professor John Fahey has written articles on the subject, I would like to explore more of the international backstory of how Dutch interest in Spokane was cultivated over time, and I am also implementing more Dutch perspectives, with around half of the reference materials made up of historic Dutch newspapers, magazines and books. To explore the aspects of identity, I am broadening the scope from just commercial imagery to costume catalogs, parades, fairs and architecture.

I am in the process of writing this work now, where it will ultimately be a public history oriented digital exhibit. I refer to each piece of this as a section rather than a chapter because I am envisioning them as being slimmer, with more focus on curating the primary source material for reader comprehension rather than a lot of theory on my part as the author. I will also be working on the digital infrastructure of the digital exhibit itself, although the concept is pretty straightforward compared to some of the digital humanities projects I've worked. on in the past. At the moment, I'm thinking of a "scrollytelling" essay format where the text and high resolution images can interact and intersperse mapping elements to highlight the international context of the story. 

Regarding methodologies, this is a visual resources oriented history project consisting of 100 images that have been digitized from archives across Spokane. The challenge in interweaving that many images is to pace things out effective in tandem with the writing so the reading experience is immersive rather than over stimulating or distracting. 

Amongst any other feedback that comes to mind, I am interested in possibly expanding on this digital exhibit as published work in the future. If there are any elements that seem like they would work well as a proof of concept in digital form for interested parties (or other elements that you might omit), I would be interested in how I can maybe truncate this public facing work to expand on at a later date. 

The publishing of this digital exhibit is tentatively planned for January 1st.
